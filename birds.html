      <h1>Birds of conservation concern in Ireland</h1>
      <p>
        There are a number of birds in Ireland whose numbers are in decline.
        Some of those with a high priority for conservation are:
      </p>

      <h2>Barn Owl</h2>
      <p>
        The barn owl is the most common owl and is found in most parts of the
        world. It has seen a huge decline in Ireland and Europe in recent years.

      <p>
        Curlews use their long bills to search for worms in mud or very soft
        ground.

      <h2>Yellowhammer</h2>
      <p>
        The yellowhammer is a large bunting with a yellow head and a streaked
        brown back. It usually lives in dry, open countryside with some trees or
        hedges.

      <h2>Lapwing</h2>
      <p>The lapwing is black and white with a wispy crest.</p>
      <p>It is a wader which means you can see it in wetland areas.</p>
